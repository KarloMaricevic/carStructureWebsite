                    A spark plug is a
                    device for delivering electric current from an ignition system to the combustion chamber of a
                    spark-ignition engine to ignite the compressed fuel/air mixture by an electric spark, while
                    containing combustion pressure within the engine. A spark plug has a metal threaded shell,
                    electrically isolated from a central electrode by a porcelain insulator. The central electrode,
                    which may contain a resistor, is connected by a heavily insulated wire to the output terminal of an
                    ignition coil or magneto. The spark plug's metal shell is screwed into the engine's cylinder head
                    and thus electrically grounded. The central electrode protrudes through the porcelain insulator into
                    the combustion chamber, forming one or more spark gaps between the inner end of the central
                    electrode and usually one or more protuberances or structures attached to the inner end of the
                    threaded shell and designated the side, earth, or ground electrode(s).

                    The valves are typically operated by a camshaft rotating at half the speed of the crankshaft. It has
                    a series of cams along its length, each designed to open a valve during the appropriate part of an
                    intake or exhaust stroke. A tappet between valve and cam is a contact surface on which the cam
                    slides to open the valve. Many engines use one or more camshafts “above” a row (or each row) of
                    cylinders, as in the illustration, in which each cam directly actuates a valve through a flat
                    tappet. In other engine designs the camshaft is in the crankcase, in which case each cam usually
                    contacts a push rod, which contacts a rocker arm that opens a valve, or in case of a flathead engine
                    a push rod is not necessary. The overhead cam design typically allows higher engine speeds because
                    it provides the most direct path between cam and valve.

                    A piston is a component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors and pneumatic
                    cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a
                    cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from
                    expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump,
                    the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose
                    of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a
                    valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder.

                    A piston ring is a split ring that fits into a groove on the outer diameter of a piston in a
                    reciprocating engine such as an internal combustion engine or steam engine. The main functions of
                    piston rings in reciprocating engines are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sealing the combustion chamber so that there is minimal loss of gases to the crank case</li>
                        <li>Improving heat transfer from the piston to the cylinder wall</li>
                        <li>Maintaining the proper quantity of the oil between the piston and the cylinder wall</li>
                        <li>Regulating engine oil consumption by scraping oil from the cylinder walls back to the sump
                        </li>

                    A connecting rod is a rigid member which connects a piston to a crank or crankshaft in a
                    reciprocating engine. Together with the crank, it forms a simple mechanism that converts
                    reciprocating motion into rotating motion. A connecting rod may also convert rotating motion into
                    reciprocating motion, its original use. Earlier mechanisms, such as the chain, could only impart
                    pulling motion. Being rigid, a connecting rod may transmit either push or pull, allowing the rod to
                    rotate the crank through both halves of a revolution. In a few two-stroke engines the connecting rod
                    is only required to push. Today, the connecting rod is best known through its use in internal
                    combustion piston engines, such as automobile engines. These are of a distinctly different design
                    from earlier forms of connecting rod used in steam engines and steam locomotives.

                    A crankshaft—related to crank—is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between
                    reciprocating motion and rotational motion. In a reciprocating engine, it translates reciprocating
                    motion of the piston into rotational motion; whereas in a reciprocating compressor, it converts the
                    rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the
                    crankshaft has "crank throws" or "crankpins", additional bearing surfaces
                    whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the "big ends" of the connecting rods from
                    each cylinder attach.
