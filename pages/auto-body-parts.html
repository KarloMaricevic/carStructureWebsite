                    Car door is a type of door, typically hinged, but sometimes attached by other mechanisms such as
                    tracks, in front of an opening which is used for entering and exiting a vehicle. A vehicle door can
                    be opened to provide access to the opening, or closed to secure it. These doors can be opened
                    manually, or powered electronically. Powered doors are usually found on minivans, high-end cars, or
                    modified cars.

                    The hood (North American English) or bonnet (Commonwealth English excluding Canada) is the hinged
                    cover over the engine of motor vehicles that allows access to the engine compartment, or trunk (boot
                    in Commonwealth English) on rear-engine and some mid-engine vehicles) for maintenance and repair.In
                    British terminology, hood refers to a fabric cover over the passenger compartment of the car
                    (known as the 'top' in the US). In many motor vehicles built in the 1930s and 1940s, the resemblance
                    to an actual hood or bonnet is clear when open and viewed head-on; in modern vehicles it continues
                    to serve the same purpose but no longer resembles a head covering.Hoods are typically made out of
                    steel, but aluminum is rapidly gaining popularity with auto
                    companies. Aftermarket manufacturers may construct hoods out of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or dry
                    carbon.

                    The trunk or luggage compartment is most often located at the rear of the vehicle. Early designs
                    included an exterior rack mounted on the rear of the vehicle to which it was possible to attach a
                    real luggage trunk. Later designs integrated the storage area into the vehicle's body and evolved
                    to provide a streamlined appearance. The main storage compartment is normally provided at the
                    end of the vehicle opposite to which the engine is located.

                    The windshield (North American English) or windscreen (Commonwealth English) of an aircraft, car,
                    bus, motorbike or tram is the front window, which provides visibility whilst protecting occupants
                    from the elements. Modern windshields are generally made of laminated safety glass, a type of
                    treated glass, which consists of, typically, two curved sheets of glass with a plastic layer
                    laminated between them for safety, and bonded into the window frame.
