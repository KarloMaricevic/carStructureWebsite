                    A particulate air filter is a device composed of fibrous or porous materials which removes solid
                    particulates such as dust, pollen, mold, and bacteria from the air. Filters containing an adsorbent
                    or catalyst such as charcoal (carbon) may also remove odors and gaseous pollutants such as volatile
                    organic compounds or ozone. Air filters are used in applications where air quality is important,
                    notably in building ventilation systems and in engines.

                    A mass (air) flow sensor (MAF) is a sensor used to determine the mass flow rate of air entering a
                    fuel-injected internal combustion engine. The air mass information is necessary for the engine
                    control unit (ECU) to balance and deliver the
                    correct fuel mass to the engine. Air changes its density with temperature and pressure. In
                    automotive applications, air density varies with the ambient temperature, altitude and the use of
                    forced induction, which means that mass flow sensors are more appropriate than volumetric flow
                    sensors for determining the quantity of intake air in each cylinder.

                    In automotive engineering, an inlet manifold or intake manifold is the part of
                    an engine that supplies the fuel/air mixture to the cylinders. The word manifold comes from the Old
                    English word manigfeald (from the Anglo-Saxon manig [many] and feald [repeatedly]) and refers to the
                    multiplying of one (pipe) into many.In contrast, an exhaust manifold collects the exhaust gases from
                    multiple cylinders into a smaller
                    number of pipes â€“ often down to one pipe. The primary function of the intake manifold is to evenly
                    distribute the combustion mixture (or just
                    air in a direct injection engine) to each intake port in the cylinder head(s). Even distribution is
                    important to optimize the efficiency and performance of the engine. It may also serve as a mount for
                    the carburetor, throttle body, fuel injectors and other components of the engine.
