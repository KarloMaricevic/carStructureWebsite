                    Coil springs for vehicles are typically made of hardened steel. A machine called an auto-coiler
                    takes spring wire that has been heated so it can easily be shaped. It is then fed onto a lathe that
                    has a metal rod with the desired coil spring size. The machine takes the wire and guides it onto the
                    spinning rod as well as pushing it across the rod to form multiple coils. The spring is then ejected
                    from the machine and an operator will put it in oil to cool off. The spring is then tempered to lose
                    the brittleness from being cooled. The coil size and strength can be controlled by the lathe rod
                    size and material used. Different alloys are used to get certain characteristics out of the spring,
                    such as stiffness, dampening and strength.

                    A shock absorber or damper is a mechanical or hydraulic device designed to absorb and damp shock
                    impulses. It does this by converting the kinetic energy of the shock into another form of energy
                    (typically heat) which is then dissipated. Most shock absorbers are a form of dashpot (a damper
                    which resists motion via viscous friction).
                    Types of vehicle shock absorbers:

                    An anti-roll bar (roll bar, anti-sway bar, sway bar, stabilizer bar) is a part of many automobile
                    suspensions that helps reduce the body roll of a vehicle during fast cornering or over road
                    irregularities. It connects opposite (left/right) wheels together through short lever arms linked by
                    a torsion spring. A sway bar increases the suspension's roll stiffnessâ€”its resistance to roll in
                    turns, independent of its spring rate in the vertical direction. The first stabilizer bar patent was
                    awarded to Canadian inventor Stephen Coleman of Fredericton, New Brunswick on April 22, 1919.
