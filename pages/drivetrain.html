                    A flywheel is a mechanical device specifically designed to efficiently store rotational energy.
                    Flywheels resist changes in rotational speed by their moment of inertia. The amount of energy stored
                    in a flywheel is proportional to the square of its rotational speed. The way to change a flywheel's
                    stored energy is by increasing or decreasing its rotational speed by applying a torque aligned with
                    its axis of symmetry. Since flywheels act as mechanical energy storage devices, they are the
                    kinetic-energy-storage analogue to electrical capacitors, for example, which are a type of
                    accumulator.

                    A clutch is a mechanical device which engages and disengages power transmission especially from
                    driving shaft to driven shaft. In the simplest application, clutches connect and disconnect two
                    rotating shafts (drive shafts or
                    line shafts). In these devices, one shaft is typically attached to an engine or other power unit
                    (the driving member) while the other shaft (the driven member) provides output power for work. While
                    typically the motions involved are rotary, linear clutches are also possible. In a torque-controlled
                    drill, for instance, one shaft is driven by a motor and the other drives a
                    drill chuck. The clutch connects the two shafts so they may be locked together and spin at the same
                    speed (engaged), locked together but spinning at different speeds (slipping), or unlocked and
                    spinning at different speeds (disengaged).

                    A transmission is a machine in a power transmission system, which provides controlled application of
                    the power. Often the term transmission refers simply to the gearbox that uses gears and gear trains
                    to provide speed and torque conversions from a rotating power source to another device. The most
                    common use is in motor vehicles, where the transmission adapts the output of the internal combustion
                    engine to the drive wheels. Such engines need to operate at a relatively high rotational speed,
                    which is inappropriate for starting, stopping, and slower travel. The transmission reduces the
                    higher engine speed to the slower wheel speed, increasing torque in the process. Transmissions are
                    also used on pedal bicycles, fixed machines, and where different rotational speeds and torques are
                    adapted.

                    A drive shaft, driveshaft, driving shaft, tailshaft (Australian English), propeller shaft (prop
                    shaft), or Cardan shaft is a mechanical component for transmitting torque and rotation, usually used
                    to connect other components of a drive train that cannot be connected directly because of distance
                    or the need to allow for relative movement between them. As torque carriers, drive shafts are
                    subject to torsion and shear stress, equivalent to the
                    difference between the input torque and the load. They must therefore be strong enough to bear the
                    stress, while avoiding too much additional weight as that would in turn increase their inertia.
