                    The brake caliper is the assembly which houses the brake pads and pistons. The pistons are usually
                    made of plastic, aluminium or chrome-plated steel. Calipers are of two types, floating or fixed. A
                    fixed caliper does not move relative to the disc and
                    is thus less tolerant of disc imperfections. It uses one or more pairs of opposing pistons to clamp
                    from each side of the disc, and is more complex and expensive than a floating caliper.

                    Brake pads are a component of disc brakes used in automotive and other applications. Brake pads are
                    steel backing plates with friction material bound to the surface that faces the disc brake rotor.
                    Brake pads convert the kinetic energy of the vehicle to thermal energy through friction. Two brake
                    pads are contained in the brake caliper, with their friction surfaces facing the rotor. When the
                    brakes are hydraulically applied, the caliper clamps or squeezes the two pads together onto the
                    spinning rotor to slow/stop the vehicle. When a brake pad heats up due to contact with the rotor, it
                    transfers small amounts of its friction material onto the disc, leaving a dull grey coating on it.
                    The brake pad and disc (both now having the friction material), then "stick" to each other,
                    providing the friction that stops the vehicle.

                    The brake disc (or rotor) is the rotating part of a wheel's disc brake assembly, against which the
                    brake pads are applied. The material is typically gray iron, a form of cast iron. The design of
                    the discs varies somewhat. Some are simply solid, but others are hollowed out with fins or vanes
                    joining together the disc's two contact surfaces (usually included as part of a casting process).
                    The weight and power of the vehicle determines the need for ventilated discs. The "ventilated"
                    disc design helps to dissipate the generated heat and is commonly used on the more-heavily loaded
                    front discs.

                    Brake hoses are used to transfer brake fluid to the brake calliper and force the brake pads onto the
                    brake discs. They should not be confused with brake lining even though they are sometimes referred
                    to as brake lines.On an Elise the standard brake hoses are made from rubber which is fine up to a
                    point, however these
                    hoses tend to expand under the hydraulic pressure from the brake system, this results in the effort
                    from your foot expanding the hose instead of stopping the car. Primarily this reduces brake feel.
                    Upgrading these (usually to stainless steel braided Teflon hoses) results in a firmer, more positive
                    brake pedal with less pedal travel. There are four brake hoses on the Elise and the procedure for
                    changing them is relatively involved.

                    ABS is an automated system that uses the principles of threshold braking and cadence braking,
                    techniques which were once practised by skilful drivers before ABSes were widespread. ABS operates
                    at a much faster rate and more effectively than most drivers could manage. Although ABS generally
                    offers improved vehicle control and decreases stopping distances on dry and some slippery surfaces,
                    on loose gravel or snow-covered surfaces ABS may significantly increase braking distance, while
                    still improving steering control.

                    A brake booster is an enhanced master cylinder setup used to reduce the amount of pedal pressure
                    needed for braking. It employs a booster set up to act with the master cylinder to give higher
                    hydraulic pressure to the brakes and/or lower force applied on the brake pedal through a brake
                    booster push-rod. The brake booster usually uses vacuum from the engine intake to boost the force
                    applied by the pedal onto the master cylinder or may employ an extra vacuum pump to enable it.
                    Without the engine running the brake pedal feels very hard and ineffective on the braking
                    capability.

                    In automotive engineering, the master cylinder is a control device that converts force (commonly
                    from a driver's foot) into hydraulic pressure. This device controls slave cylinders located at the
                    other end of the hydraulic system. As piston(s) move along the bore of the master cylinder, this
                    movement is transferred through the
                    hydraulic fluid, to result in a movement of the slave cylinder(s). The hydraulic pressure created by
                    moving a piston (inside the bore of the master cylinder) toward the slave cylinder(s) compresses the
                    fluid evenly, but by varying the comparative surface area of the master cylinder and each slave
                    cylinder, one can vary the amount of force and displacement applied to each slave cylinder, relative
                    to the amount of force and displacement applied to the master cylinder.
