                    A headlamp is a lamp attached to the front of a vehicle to illuminate the road ahead. Headlamps are
                    also often called headlights, but in the most precise usage, headlamp is the term for the device
                    itself and headlight is the term for the beam of light produced and distributed by the device.
                    Headlamp performance has steadily improved throughout the automobile age, spurred by the great
                    disparity between daytime and nighttime traffic fatalities: the US National Highway Traffic Safety
                    Administration states that nearly half of all traffic-related fatalities occur in the dark, despite
                    only 25% of traffic travelling during darkness.

                    Conspicuity for the rear of a vehicle is provided by rear position lamps (also called tail lamps or
                    tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit
                    whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. Rear position lamps
                    may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function
                    installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light
                    for the rear position lamp function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios
                    between the bright (stop) and dim (rear position) modes, so that a vehicle displaying rear position
                    lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.

                    Fog lamps provide a wide, bar-shaped beam of light with a sharp cutoff at the top, and are generally
                    aimed and mounted low. They may produce white or selective yellow light, and were designed
                    for use at low speed to increase the illumination directed towards the road surface and verges in
                    conditions of poor visibility due to rain, fog, dust or snow. They are sometimes used in place of
                    dipped-beam headlamps, reducing the glare-back from fog or
                    falling snow, although the legality varies by jurisdiction of using front fog lamps without low beam
                    headlamps.

                    Turn signals—formally called "direction indicators" or "directional signals", and informally known
                    as "directionals", "blinkers", "indicators" or "flashers"—are blinking lamps mounted near the left
                    and right front and rear corners of a vehicle, and sometimes on the sides or on the side mirrors of
                    a vehicle, activated by the driver on one side of the vehicle at a time to advertise intent to turn
                    or change lanes towards that side.

                    The power-door-lock actuator is a pretty straightforward device. ­This system is quite simple. A
                    small electric motor turns a series of spur gears that serve as a gear reduction. The last gear
                    drives a rack-and-pinion gearset that is connected to the actuator rod. The rack converts the
                    rotational motion of the motor into the linear motion needed to move the lock.
