                    Radiators are heat exchangers used for cooling internal combustion engines, mainly in automobiles
                    but also in piston-engined aircraft, railway locomotives, motorcycles, stationary generating plant
                    or any similar use of such an engine. Internal combustion engines are often cooled by circulating a
                    liquid called engine coolant through
                    the engine block, where it is heated, then through a radiator where it loses heat to the atmosphere,
                    and then returned to the engine. Engine coolant is usually water-based, but may also be oil. It is
                    common to employ a water pump to force the engine coolant to circulate, and also for an axial fan to
                    force air through the radiator.

                    Radiators first used downward vertical flow, driven solely by a thermosyphon effect. Coolant is
                    heated in the engine, becomes less dense, and so rises. As the radiator cools the fluid, the coolant
                    becomes denser and falls. This effect is sufficient for low-power stationary engines, but inadequate
                    for all but the earliest automobiles. All automobiles for many years have used centrifugal pumps to
                    circulate the engine coolant because natural circulation has very low flow rates.

                    A system of valves or baffles, or both, is usually incorporated to simultaneously operate a small
                    radiator inside the vehicle. This small radiator, and the associated blower fan, is called the
                    heater core, and serves to warm the cabin interior. Like the radiator, the heater core acts by
                    removing heat from the engine. For this reason, automotive technicians often advise operators to
                    turn on the heater and set it to high if the engine is overheating, to assist the main radiator.

                    The engine temperature on modern cars is primarily controlled by a wax-pellet type of thermostat, a
                    valve which opens once the engine has reached its optimum operating temperature. When the engine is
                    cold, the thermostat is closed except for a small bypass flow so that the
                    thermostat experiences changes to the coolant temperature as the engine warms up. Engine coolant is
                    directed by the thermostat to the inlet of the circulating pump and is returned directly to the
                    engine, bypassing the radiator. Directing water to circulate only through the engine allows the
                    engine to reach optimum operating temperature as quickly as possible whilst avoiding localised "hot
                    spots." Once the coolant reaches the thermostat's activation temperature, it opens, allowing water
                    to flow through the radiator to prevent the temperature rising higher.
